Hey!

I'm Cluedobot
Let's begin play, if your'e done with setting up the board

Since I'm the computer player, I get to choose my character...
Why you ask? Well, that's because I'm the computer player, not you!

I'm Miss Scarlet
Deal me my cards, but DON'T LOOK AT THEM!
Just input the codes written on the outside of the cards
whenever I prompt

For your information, the prompt is >>


By the way, how many cards do I have?
>>3
Input the codes
>>19185
>>98461
>>85214
Thank you!
Let me create my checklist now...

Checking Off Items...

COMPLETE!

Lets Play!

I'm Miss Scarlet and the rules of the game state that Miss Scarlet should begin play! WOO HOO!
I'm going to roll the die now...
The number sandwiched between the two lines is the number shown by my virtual die
After that you will see a set of instructions telling you where to move my piece
My piece has to be moved with respect to the initial position of Miss Scarlet
I will alert you whenever I realise I have entered a room
If I have not entered a room, I will prompt you to input any codes that other players reveal to possess
SOME MORE INSTRUCTIONS 
<press 1 to input codes>
<press 2 to see my latest suggestion>
<press 3 to see these INSTRUCTIONS>
<press 4 to EXIT>


Now press any NUMBER to begin...

Hey!

I'm Cluedobot
Let's begin play, if your'e done with setting up the board

Since I'm the computer player, I get to choose my character...
Why you ask? Well, that's because I'm the computer player, not you!

I'm Miss Scarlet
Deal me my cards, but DON'T LOOK AT THEM!
Just input the codes written on the outside of the cards
whenever I prompt

For your information, the prompt is >>


By the way, how many cards do I have?
>>3
Nice! Now its time for you to input the codes
>>1 
>>1
>>1
Thank you!
Let me create my checklist now...

Checking Off Items...

COMPLETE!

Lets Play!

I'm Miss Scarlet and the rules of the game state that Miss Scarlet should begin play! WOO HOO!
I'm going to roll the die now...
The number sandwiched between the two lines is the number shown by my virtual die
After that you will see a set of instructions telling you where to move my piece
My piece has to be moved with respect to the initial position of Miss Scarlet
I will alert you whenever I realise I have entered a room
If I have not entered a room, I will prompt you to input any codes that other players reveal to possess
SOME MORE INSTRUCTIONS 
<press 1 to input codes>
<press 2 to see my latest suggestion>
<press 3 to see these INSTRUCTIONS>
<press 4 to EXIT>


Now press any NUMBER to begin...
>>1

		Here comes my Menu... Choose an option appropriately

		<1>Input CODES
		<2>View LATEST SUGGESTIONS
		<3>HELP

Ok... I'm in need of codes, so input it

Hey!

I'm Cluedobot
Let's begin play, if your'e done with setting up the board

Since I'm the computer player, I get to choose my character...
Why you ask? Well, that's because I'm the computer player, not you!

I'm Miss Scarlet
Deal me my cards, but DON'T LOOK AT THEM!
Just input the codes written on the outside of the cards
whenever I prompt

For your information, the prompt is >>


By the way, how many cards do I have?
>>3
You've got to input those codes now! DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE!
>>1
>>1
>>1
Thank you!
Let me create my checklist now...

Checking Off Items...

COMPLETE!

Lets Play!

I'm Miss Scarlet and the rules of the game state that Miss Scarlet should begin play! WOO HOO!
I'm going to roll the die now...
The number sandwiched between the two lines is the number shown by my virtual die
After that you will see a set of instructions telling you where to move my piece
My piece has to be moved with respect to the initial position of Miss Scarlet
I will alert you whenever I realise I have entered a room
If I have not entered a room, I will prompt you to input any codes that other players reveal to possess
SOME MORE INSTRUCTIONS

Hey!

I'm Cluedobot
Let's begin play, if your'e done with setting up the board

Since I'm the computer player, I get to choose my character...
Why you ask? Well, that's because I'm the computer player, not you!

I'm Miss Scarlet
Deal me my cards, but DON'T LOOK AT THEM!
Just input the codes written on the outside of the cards
whenever I prompt

For your information, the prompt is >>


By the way, how many cards do I have?
>>3
Input the codes
>>19185
>>98461
>>85214
Thank you!
Let me create my checklist now...

Checking Off Items...

COMPLETE!

Lets Play!

I'm Miss Scarlet and the rules of the game state that Miss Scarlet should begin play! WOO HOO!
I'm going to roll the die now...
The number sandwiched between the two lines is the number shown by my virtual die
After that you will see a set of instructions telling you where to move my piece
My piece has to be moved with respect to the initial position of Miss Scarlet
I will alert you whenever I realise I have entered a room
If I have not entered a room, I will prompt you to input any codes that other players reveal to possess
SOME MORE INSTRUCTIONS 
<press 1 to input codes>
<press 2 to see my latest suggestion>
<press 3 to see these INSTRUCTIONS>
<press 4 to EXIT>


Now press any NUMBER to begin...

Hey!

I'm Cluedobot
Let's begin play, if your'e done with setting up the board

Since I'm the computer player, I get to choose my character...
Why you ask? Well, that's because I'm the computer player, not you!

I'm Miss Scarlet
Deal me my cards, but DON'T LOOK AT THEM!
Just input the codes written on the outside of the cards
whenever I prompt

For your information, the prompt is >>


By the way, how many cards do I have?
>>3
Ok... I'm in need of codes, so input it

Nice! Now its time for you to input the codes

Thank you!
Let me create my checklist now...

Checking Off Items...

COMPLETE!

Lets Play!

I'm Miss Scarlet and the rules of the game state that Miss Scarlet should begin play! WOO HOO!
I'm going to roll the die now...
The number sandwiched between the two lines is the number shown by my virtual die
After that you will see a set of instructions telling you where to move my piece
My piece has to be moved with respect to the initial position of Miss Scarlet
I will alert you whenever I realise I have entered a room
If I have not entered a room, I will prompt you to input any codes that other players reveal to possess
SOME MORE INSTRUCTIONS

Hey!

I'm Cluedobot
Let's begin play, if your'e done with setting up the board

Since I'm the computer player, I get to choose my character...
Why you ask? Well, that's because I'm the computer player, not you!

I'm Miss Scarlet
Deal me my cards, but DON'T LOOK AT THEM!
Just input the codes written on the outside of the cards
whenever I prompt

For your information, the prompt is >>


By the way, how many cards do I have?
>>1
You've got to input those codes now! DON'T MAKE A MISTAKE!
>>1
Thank you!
Let me create my checklist now...

Checking Off Items...

COMPLETE!

Lets Play!

I'm Miss Scarlet and the rules of the game state that Miss Scarlet should begin play! WOO HOO!
I'm going to roll the die now...
The number sandwiched between the two lines is the number shown by my virtual die
After that you will see a set of instructions telling you where to move my piece
My piece has to be moved with respect to the initial position of Miss Scarlet
I will alert you whenever I realise I have entered a room
If I have not entered a room, I will prompt you to input any codes that other players reveal to possess
SOME MORE INSTRUCTIONS 
<press 1 to input codes>
